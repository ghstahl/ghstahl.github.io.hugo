      <description>As I write this, it should be also filed under the &amp;ldquo;Enough with the never ending REST apis&amp;rdquo; Category. This Api will eventually be implemented in my Facebook GraphQL work.
Background I wanted a single REST api that would be able to fetch all strings in a Resx for a given language. Furthermore, I should be able to pick how those strings were to be packaged. Some developers like object trees, others might need json arrays that look more like database records.</description>
